# Brianne
All final coding work used in the project completed by Brianne is in the final_analysis.ipynb file in the 'Brianne' folder.
Data cleaning for the project can be found in analysis_cleanup.ipynb.
CSV files used can be found in 'Resources' folder within 'Brianne' folder.

- In final_analysis.ipynb, I started by loading in a CSV file from the United States Census Bureau that had data from 2018 - 2022 about monthly housing costs.
- I created a dataframe with this data and was able to create graphs, such as one that displays the monthly housing costs and how many housing units.

- Another CSV is loaded in, also from the United States Census Bureau, that has data from 2018 - 2022 about the percentage of income spent on monthly housing costs.
- With this data, I was able to create a dataframe and create another graph that displays the monthly owner costs as a percentage of household income.
